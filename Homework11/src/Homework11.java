Part I: B-Trees

Draw the tree that results from adding the values 12, 24, 32, 42, 48, 56, 67, 83, 89, and 95 to an empty 2-3 tree.
Draw the tree that results from adding these same values to an empty 2-4 tree.
For #1 and #2, show what the tree looks like after each element is added. You do not need to show the splitting steps,
but you must show what the tree looks like after each insertion.
(There should be 10 trees in your answer to #1 and 10 trees in your answer to #2).
See Part1AllAnswers.pdf

Part II: Graphs

For the three graphs below, describe each of the following:
directed/undirected
number of nodes
number of edges
unweighted/weighted
connected/disconnected
complete/not complete
cyclic/acyclic
a.
directed/undirected: undirected
number of nodes: 4
number of edges: 3
unweighted/weighted: unweighted
connected/disconnected: disconnected
complete/not complete: complete
cyclic/acyclic: cyclic
b.
directed/undirected: undirected
number of nodes: 6
number of edges: 10
unweighted/weighted: unweighted
connected/disconnected: connected
complete/not complete: complete
cyclic/acyclic: cyclic
c.
directed/undirected: undirected
number of nodes: 4
number of edges: 5
unweighted/weighted: unweighted
connected/disconnected: connected
complete/not complete: not complete
cyclic/acyclic: cyclic

Trace the traversal of the graph below using the type of traversal and the starting vertex below.
(To be consistent, use alphabetic ordering for the order in which neighbors are visited.)
breadth-first, starting at A
A, D, J, G, B, F, E (never gets to C)
breadth-first, starting at C
C, B, E, H, D, A, J, G, E
depth-first, starting at A
A, D, J, G, B, F, E (H and C are never visited
depth-first, starting at C
C, B, D, J, G, F, E, H, A

Part III: Chapter 24, Page 727 / Chapter 30 Page 816: 8, 11; Extra Credit: 16, EC

#8 (the topological ordering)
See Part3.pdf
#11 (the map): for part b, provide two different sets of edges that could be removed to make the graph a tree.
Extra Credit: #16: I recommend using the interactive map on the Jet Blue website: http://www.jetblue.com/WhereWeJet/.
If you use this, use Buffalo, NY instead of Albany, NY.
If you use a different airline, you must include the map or the URL in your answer.
Extra Credit EC: Describe real-world situations that could be represented by a graph with the properties below.
For each graph, describe what the nodes are and what an edge represents.
directed and disconnected
undirected and disconnected
complete
Part IV: Chapter 25, Page 750 / Chapter 31, Page 839: 1-4, 6-7, 17


For the questions that ask you to draw a tree, you can include your answer in whatever way is easiest.
You can draw the answer on paper and then scan the answer or take a picture of it with a
phone - however you can capture it is fine! I recommend a free program called draw io: https://www.draw.io/â€Ž.
This is the program I use to create the trees for the online notes. I find it very user-friendly.

However you create the pictures of your trees, make sure that the pictures are clearly labeled and organized.
This means either naming each file with the chapter/exercise number or putting each picture into one main doc/pdf file.
It's your responsibility to make sure it's easy for me/the graders to find your answers!
